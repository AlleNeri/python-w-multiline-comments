# python-w-multiline-comments
A simple script to execute the `.py` version of notebooks generated by Google Colab.

## Usage
```bash
main.py [TARGET] [-i]
```
It prints the multiline comments from the `[TARGET]` file and executes the script snippets.
If the `-i` flag is present, it will execute the script interactively.
Typing `q` will exit the interactive mode.
Single line comments in the form of `# pwmc:no_exec` at the start of a code snippet will prevent it from being executed.

## Warning
This script doesn't have any kind of security check on the code snippets from `[TARGET]` file.
It is recommended to only use this script with trusted files.
