  filename              The python file to execute

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --all             Run all the script in non-interactive mode
  -ff, --fast-forward FAST_FORWARD
                        Fast forward the execution to the Nth snippet or to the comment containing the specified string. (only in interactive mode)
  -l, --load-path LOAD_PATH [LOAD_PATH ...]
                        Additional paths to load modules from. If not specified, the current directory is used.
```

## Warning
This script doesn't have any kind of security check on the code snippets from `filename`.
It is recommended to only use this script with trusted files.
