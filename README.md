# python-w-multiline-comments
A simple script to execute the `.py` version of notebooks generated by Google Colab.

## Usage
```bash
main.py [-h] [-a] [-ff FAST_FORWARD] filename
```
It prints the multiline comments from the `filename` and executes the script snippets.
If the `-a` flag is present, it will execute the the whole script in non-interactively mode.
Typing `q` will exit the interactive mode.
Single line comments in the form of `# pwmc:no_exec` at the start of a code snippet will prevent it from being executed.
The `-ff` flag can be used only in interactive mode and will fast forward the execution to the specified snippet number (it counts both the multiline comments snippets and the code snippets) or to the first multiline comment which contains the specified string.

## Warning
This script doesn't have any kind of security check on the code snippets from `[TARGET]` file.
It is recommended to only use this script with trusted files.
